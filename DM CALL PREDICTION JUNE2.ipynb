    "APPROACH: start with a basic, working DL model and simplify/augment to optimizer prediction accuracy\n",
    "- using this article on structured DL (i.e. DL on structured data, as opposed to common DL examples on unstructured data like images & audio) https://towardsdatascience.com/structured-deep-learning-b8ca4138b848 as a starting point, look for some examples of end-to-end DL on structured data. This article refers to a Kaggle competition on structured data, an entry in which https://www.kaggle.com/knowledgegrappler/a-simple-nn-solution-with-keras-0-48611-pl , for example, is a great end-to-end example\n",
    "- use Keras (Python DL framework built on top of TensorFlow) - sweet spot for a simple, working DL model. Keras has decent documentation and a big enough community that answers to many questions are readily available\n",
    "- once input data working through model, tune the following parameters to optimize validation/test accuracy (accuracy of prediction on data not used to generate model weights):\n",
    "- learning rate (to avoid local minima and oscillation)\n",
    "- dropout rate (control overfitting by randomly dropping nodes)\n",
    "- lambda for L2 regularization (control overfitting by \"suppressing\" large weights)\n",
    "- batch size (the number of training examples in a forward/backward pass)\n",
    "- epochs run (number of complete passes through dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "ENVIRONMENTS USED:\n",
    "- public cloud DSX: for most development and testing after initial setup and prior to adding non-Db2 data. PROS: convenient, persistent sessions, no cost; CONS: performance ~ 30% slower than PaperSpace, memory errors trying to run model on larger data set including text analysis\n",
    "- Paperspace (https://www.paperspace.com/) low-cost generic GPU-enabled Linux environemnt. Used instructions from Jeremy Howard fast.ai course V2 to setup. PROS: better perf, able to handle text processing w. largest data set without memory errors, standard filesystem; CONS: setup not straightforward, inconvenience of having to start & stop environment\n",
    "- initial development done on Paperspace, moved to DSX once the basics were working, then back to Paperspace after the larger data set began to generate memory errors in DSX\n",
    "\n",
    "SOURCE DATA :\n",
    "\n",
    "OVERVIEW OF CODE:\n",
    "- ingest CSVs: need distinct code for DSX and paper\n",
    "- various cleansing / slicing and dicing to generate additional features (e.g. year and day of week from date opened). Several variations attempted (e.g. make severity a continuous variable, distort severity at extremes, exclude some severities, exclude some TTR ranges) \n",
    "- define label / target: new column in dataframe that is 0 or 1 depending on whether TTR is less than or more than 1 day\n",
    "- split data into training (which will be further split into training/validation) and test data sets (training data used to generate model weights; validation set used to track how well model predicts actual targets as hyperparameters are tuned; test set used to validate entire model (learned weights and hyperparameters)\n",
    "- fill in missing values for all features\n",
    "- in categorical columns (all feature columns currently) replace values (e.g. \"CANADA\", \"JAPAN\" for Country) with integer IDs\n",
    "- process text columns - replace words with vector of integer IDs\n",
    "- define Keras model:\n",
    "- embedding layers for all categorical features (embeddings are vectors used to learn patterns for categorical data - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding )\n",
    "- RNN layer for text feature\n",
    "- single dense output layer w. sigmoid activation to output TTR prediction\n",
